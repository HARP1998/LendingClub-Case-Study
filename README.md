## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project?
    The background of my project is for an online lending company looking for key factors before lending a customer a loan. 
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
    The business would like to see what key factors could attribute to someone defaulting on a loan so that they would know not to lend to a "risky" customer to cut down on credit loss.  
- What is the dataset that is being used?
    The dataset that is being used is a loan file in a csv format that contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011 for this company.

## Conclusions
In conclusion, income and grade status are good indicators if a customer will pay the company back. Home ownership plays more of a role on whether an individual will even take a loan but does not strongly indicate whether a customer would be likely to pay back the company.  Verification status is not very indicative if a customer will pay the company back.
